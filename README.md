# ITS-Lab
The code here is the part of work i am currently doing in ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems) Lab @NJIT

#Modifications
First version was supposed to work by creatig a Poisson distribution and random number generation in Matlab. After which the program would be exported as a package to work as a dll in the C# project

New modificiation involves the same calculation within the C# project that follows the random variate following Poisson distribution in a five step algorithm
